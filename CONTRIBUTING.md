# Contributing

Feel free to contribute to improve the quality of the content or add new content.

I understand the enthusiasm to contribute to an open source project so, before creating an issue or raising a PR please check the existing open/closed issues and PRs.

Please follow guidelines below in order to contribute.

## Before creating a Pull Request

- Create an issue with a clean and easy to understand description
- Label the issue describing the type (Labels will be available, you can pick one which suits your changes)

## Improving existing content

- If you have found some typo or grammatical mistakes in the doc please make sure if you are raising a PR, it contains multiple such fixes else you can simply create an issue pointing to the mistakes.

## Adding new content

- First create an issue as described [here](#before-creating-a-pull-request)

- **If you will also create a PR**
  - [Optional] You can mention the deadline by when you are planning to create a PR
  - Raise the PR making sure you follow the [commit guideline](#commit-guideline)
  - Add the link to the issue in the description this PR is addressing
- **If you want new content but want others to create**
  - Just create an issue with adequate information

## Commit Guideline

- Keep the commit message in present tense
- All the letters should be in lower cases
- Don't provide a full stop at end of the message
